## Overview ##
This was the first project as part of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Course. I chose to create an adaptation of the classic arcade game 'Space Invaders'.

## Brief ##
The brief was to create a grid-based game chosen from a list of options.
### Technical Requirements ###
* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Use **Javascript** for **DOM manipulation**
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
