# Project 1 - Space Invaders #

## Overview ##
This was the first project as part of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Course. I chose to create an adaptation of the classic arcade game 'Space Invaders'.

## Brief ##
The brief was to create a grid-based game chosen from a list of options over a week.
### Technical Requirements ###
* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Use **Javascript** for **DOM manipulation**
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
### Necessary Deliverables ###
* A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
* HTML Canvas is *not* to be used.

## Built With ##
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Git
